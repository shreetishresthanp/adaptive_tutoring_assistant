Sample Assumption Question \n
Consider the following example: \n
1. The birth rate in Country X is down this year by 12% compared to last year. The
death rate in Country X has remained stable for several years. Therefore, the
population of Country X is decreasing measurably.
Which of the following is assumed by the author of the argument above? \n
(A) The causes of the declining birthrate in Country X can be discovered
through physician surveys. \n
(B) Statisticians are able to predict future changes in the size of the population
of Country X. \n
(C) Country Y, which has a nearly identical population to Country X, is experiencing
the same population shift as Country X. \n
(D) There was no significant migration into Country X during the time under
discussion. \n
(E) The causes of the declining birthrate in Country X are primarily economic
in nature. \n

"""

Assumption_ans = """

The best answer is D. You might be able to answer the question directly by simply recognizing
the missing piece of evidence and selecting it. However, if you aren’t able to do so,
you can still determine the correct answer by negating whichever answer choices you view
as potentially correct. It is not likely that you will have time to carefully negate each choice
presented. So, you will need to “filter out” choices that you find clearly irrelevant.
Let’s say that you could easily recognize that answer choice C is irrelevant since it
discusses Country Y and, therefore, it can’t possibly be the missing link between the
stated evidence and the stated conclusion, which both involve Country X. Likewise, let’s
say that you could eliminate answer choice B, which is about predicting the future,
whereas the stimulus argument is about the recent past. \n
That leaves answer choices A, D, and E still in contention. Try to negate answer choice
A. You should come up with something like: “The causes of the declining birthrate in
Country X cannot be discovered through physician surveys.” Since physicians play no
part in the stimulus argument, you should recognize that neither the original phrasing
of answer choice A, nor its negation, has any bearing on the relationship between the
evidence and the conclusion stated in the argument. Similarly, negating E with “The
causes of the declining birthrate in Country X are not primarily economic in nature,”
has no impact on the likelihood that the conclusion is valid. However, if you negate
answer choice D, you get “There was significant migration into Country X during the
time under discussion.” This would dramatically call into question the stated conclusion
that the population of Country X is declining measurably. Therefore, answer choice D
must be correct.

Consider the following example: \n
1. More and more computer software that is capable of correcting not just spelling,
but also grammar and punctuation is being developed. Therefore, it is increasingly
unnecessary for working reporters and writers to have a complete knowledge of the
principles of English grammar and punctuation. Consequently, in training journalists,
less emphasis should be placed on the principles of grammar so that students
and professors can concentrate on other important subjects.
Which one of the following, if true, most seriously weakens the argument given
for the recommendation above? \n
(A) The effective use of software that corrects grammar and punctuation
requires an understanding of grammatical principles. \n
(B) Much of the software that corrects grammar and punctuation is already
in use. \n
(C) Development of more complex ethical guidelines for reporters and writers
has meant that professors and students in journalism schools must allow
time for teaching such issues. \n
(D) Most of the software that is capable of correcting grammar and punctuation
can be run on the types of computers available to most media outlets. \n
(E) The journalism curriculum already requires that journalism students be
familiar with, and able to use, a variety of software packages. \n
"""

Weaken_Strengthen_ans = """
The best answer is A. If journalists must be able to understand the principles of
grammar in order to effectively use the software described, the conclusion of the argument—
that less emphasis should be placed on such principles in journalism school—is
less likely to be true. Answer choices B, D, and E are irrelevant to the argument. Answer
choice C actually strengthens the argument by making the conclusion just slightly more
likely to be true. \n

1. Physician: The continued use of this drug to treat patients with a certain disease
cannot be adequately supported by the proposition that any drug that treats the
disease is more effective than no treatment at all. What must also be taken into
account is that this drug is very expensive and has notable side effects.
Which one of the following most accurately expresses the main point of the physician’s
argument?
(A) The drug is more effective than no treatment at all. \n
(B) The drug is more effective than other forms of treatment for the disease. \n
(C) The drug is more expensive than other forms of treatment for the disease. \n
(D) The drug should not be used to treat the disease unless it is either effective 
or inexpensive. \n
(E) The drug’s possible effectiveness in treating the disease is not sufficient
justification for using it. \n
"""

Conclusion_ans = """
The best answer is E. According to the physician, the fact that the drug might be
somewhat effective is not enough reason to continue to use it. The physician suggests
that other factors beyond mere effectiveness, such as cost and side effects, be considered
when deciding whether to use the drug. Answer choice A is incorrect because, although
it might be inferred from evidence presented in the stimulus, the question stem calls for
the main point of the argument. Answer choices B and C are incorrect because no
comparison is made between the drug and any other form of treatment for the disease. \n
Answer choice D is incorrect because the physician also contends that the side effects of
the drug should be considered when deciding whether to use the drug.

1. It is widely accepted that eating sugar can cause weight gain. Indeed, many people
who are susceptible to weight gain report that, in their own experience, eating
large amounts of sugar is invariably followed by a measurable weight gain within a
few days. However, it is likely that common wisdom has confused cause and effect.
Recent studies suggest that hormonal changes associated with stress can cause
weight gain, and there is ample evidence that people who are fond of sugar tend to
eat more of it when they are under stress. 
The argument employs which one of the following argumentative strategies? \n
(A) It cites evidence that questions the accuracy of the evidence advanced in
support of the position that is being called into question. \n
(B) It gives additional evidence that suggests an alternative interpretation of the
evidence offered in support of the position being challenged. \n
(C) It relies upon the superiority of science versus common opinion as a means
of dismissing the relevance of evidence based upon common experience. \n
(D) It shows that the position being challenged is not consistent with cited,
proven factual evidence. \n
(E) It calls into question the intelligence of those who subscribe to a certain
popularly held belief. \n

1. Researchers concur with one another on the issue of the harm that can result when
children are exposed to microscopic asbestos fibers. The resulting disease, asbestosis,
is almost always debilitating and even sometimes fatal. Many older school buildings
contain asbestos insulation around hot water pipes and heating ducts because, until
recently, the dangers of asbestos were unknown. Yet, these same researchers also
agree that laws requiring the removal of asbestos from schools could actually lead
to an increased likelihood of exposure to asbestos fibers to the students who attend
those schools.
Which one of the following, if true, most helps to resolve the apparent discrepancy
in the researchers’ positions? \n
(A) New insulation materials used instead of asbestos are as potentially harmful
to children as asbestos is. \n
(B) The money that would be spent on the removal of asbestos from schools
could be spent in other ways that would be more likely to increase the
overall health of school children. \n
(C) Other sources of asbestos, such as automobile and household uses, are
responsible for more cases of asbestosis than school-based sources are. \n
(D) Removing the asbestos from older schools disperses a large quantity of
asbestos fibers into the air, where they are more easily inhaled than when
they are left in place around the pipes and ducts. \n
(E) Lead-based paint poses more of a health hazard to children than asbestos
does. \n

than the apparent conflict between the two positions that the researchers hold simultaneously:
1) that asbestos can cause serious harm, and 2) that it should not be removed from
