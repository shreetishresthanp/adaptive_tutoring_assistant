1,Assumption,Medium,"All the paintings of Vermeer are owned either by private individuals or by public museums. Among the paintings of Vermeer that are owned by private individuals, some are available for purchase and some are not. No painting of Vermeer that is owned by public museums is available for purchase. Therefore, the majority of paintings of Vermeer are not available for purchase.

Which one of the following is an assumption upon which the argument depends?",Most paintings of Vermeer that are not available for purchase are owned by private individuals.,The majority of the paintings of Vermeer that are owned by private individuals are available for purchase.,All paintings of Vermeer that are available for purchase are owned by private individuals.,The total number of paintings of Vermeer that are owned by public museums is not less than total the number owned by private individuals.,No private individual owns more than one painting of Vermeer.,D
-1,Assumption,Hard,"The print circulation of The World Tribune has shown a 40 percent decline in the past two years. However, the traffic on the newspaper's website has increased by 30 percent during the same period. The website contains many news sections and blogs that are not featured in the print newspaper but are the most read pages of the website. Therefore, to maintain its profits, the newspaper has decided to discontinue its still-profitable print edition and to introduce more content on the website that is similar to the exclusive content on the most read pages of the website.
Which one of the following is an assumption on which the decision of The World Tribune depends?",The print circulation of the newspaper would not have declined further in the near future.,"To access the content on the newspaper's website, the readers of the website will be willing to pay a monthly subscription fees that is equal to the revenue that the print edition of the newspaper earned per reader each month.",The print circulation of the newspaper declined in the past two years because the newspaper's website offered more interesting content.,The revenue earned from increased website traffic will not be less than the revenue lost by discontinuing the print edition.,Introducing more content similar to the exclusive content on the most read pages of the website will increase the newspaper's website traffic further.,E
2,Find the flaw in the Argument,Hard,"As per a report published by the United States Bureau of Economic Analysis, in the last five years, the per capita income of American workers employed in Agriculture and allied services has increased by 10 percent while that of American workers employed in other sectors has increased by 20 percent. Therefore, American workers employed in other sectors now earn a higher per capita income than those employed in Agriculture and allied services.

The argument's reasoning is questionable because the argument fails to rule out the possibility that",,,,,,B
-2,Find the flaw in the Argument,Medium,"City Mayor: Air pollution has declined significantly since the beginning of this year when the plying of fossil-fuel powered cars that were older than five years on city roads was banned. Therefore, if we ban the plying of all fossil-fuel powered cars on city roads, air pollution will end in the city.

The city mayor's argument is flawed in that it",takes for granted that all cars in the city are fossil-fuel powered,relies on statistical claims that are likely to be unreliable,fails to consider that there may be other significant sources of air pollution in the city,fails to consider that citizen protests may force the council to withdraw the proposed ban on all fossil-fuel powered cars,mistakenly reverses the cause and the effect relationship between two phenomena,C
3,Find the flaw in the Argument,Challenging,"If Amy were a tall and fair actress from the mainstream film industry, she would have won the best actress award. She is not a tall and fair actress since she has not won the best actress award.

The conclusion above is flawed because the author does not consider that Amy could",have won an award for scriptwriting,be a singer from the mainstream film industry,be a tall and fair actress from a non-mainstream film industry,be an actress belonging to a mainstream theatre group,have won an award for some other mainstream work,C
-3,Find the flaw in the Argument,Hard,"The parliamentarian has often stated that no crime that impacts only a few individual victims deserves capital punishment and, therefore, capital punishment should be awarded only for the rarest of rare crimes that threaten the survival or well-being of the society as a whole. When gruesome crimes involving only one or two victims but generally viewed as deserving capital punishment are cited as possible counterexamples, the parliamentarian justifies his stance by saying that if those crimes deserve capital punishment, they cannot have impacted only a few individual victims.

The parliamentarian's reasoning contains which one of the following errors?",It contains an unfounded acceptance of a popular opinion.,It relies on the parliamentarian's authority on legal or sociological matters.,It seeks to convince by emotion rather than logic.,It attempts to substantiate a viewpoint by appeal to an unrelated contemplation.,It assumes what it intends to substantiate.,E
-4,Inference,Medium,"In the state of Dougland, most universities offer science courses, and most of those that offer science courses also offer business courses. However, any university that offers business courses but not science courses does offer evening classes; and no privately-owned university in Dougland offers evening classes.

If the statements above are true, which one of the following must be true?",No privately-owned university in Dougland offers business courses but not science courses.,Any privately-owned university in Dougland that does not offer business courses offers science courses.,Some universities in Dougland that offer evening classes also offer science courses.,Most universities in Dougland that are not privately-owned do not offer science courses.,No universities in Dougland that offer science courses and business courses offer evening classes.,A
4,Inference,Challenging,"A hundred students of Midtown college were asked to pick their preference for one of three genres of movies: romantic, drama, and tragedy. Each of them picked one of the three genres. More than half picked romantic, more than a quarter picked drama and at least one picked tragedy. When asked about the genre of the movie Titanic, however, more than three quarter viewed it as a romantic movie.

If all of the statements above are true, which one of the following must also be true?",Only the students whose preferences were romantic and drama genres of movies viewed Titanic as a romantic movie.,Only the students whose preferences were romantic and tragedy genres of movies viewed Titanic as a romantic movie.,At least one student from each genre of movies viewed Titanic as a romantic movie.,Some students whose preference was romantic genres of movies viewed Titanic as a romantic movie.,Some students whose preference was tragedy genres of movies viewed Titanic as a romantic movie.,D
-5,Justify the Conclusion (JTC),Easy,"A test that examines people on their memory capacity for spatial layouts has placed Jason in the top 1 percentile of all test-takers. We can conclude from this that his memory capacity for things that do not involve spatial layouts will be below average.

The conclusion follows logically if which one of the following is assumed?",Jason tried hard to remember spatial layouts.,Jason has a greater proclivity to remember spatial layouts than most people.,"It is possible for Jason to improve, through practice and effort, his memory capacity for things that do not involve spatial layouts.",The total memory capacity of the human brain is fixed and equal for all people.,Some people have a greater memory capacity than others.,D
5,Justify the Conclusion (JTC),Easy,"Though RK Narayan was a popular writer, his body of work did not denounce capitalism and champion communism. Therefore, he was never considered for the Nobel Prize for Literature.

The conclusion above follows logically, if which one of the following is assumed?",Only those writers are considered for the Nobel Prize for Literature whose body of work is apolitical.,Only popular writers are considered for the Nobel Prize for Literature.,Writers who denounce communism and champion capitalism in their body of work are never considered for the Nobel Prize for Literature.,Only those writers who denounce capitalism and champion communism in their work are considered for the Nobel Prize for Literature.,"To be considered for the Nobel Prize for Literature, a writer must be popular and political.",D
6,Method of Reasoning,Hard,"Henry: An average American car driver drives a thousand miles per month. If all American car drivers drove only five miles less daily, their monthly mileage would reduce by 15 percent. Five miles is ten thousand steps, the amount of daily walking recommended by doctors for good health. Therefore, if the government could persuade car drivers to drive five miles less daily and walk that distance instead, the total transport-related carbon emissions in the United States would reduce by 15 percent.

Bill: Cars are responsible for 30 percent of all transport-related carbon emissions in the United States.

Bill's response to Henry proceeds by",refuting an assumption on which Henry's argument relies,discrediting Henry's argument by giving of erroneous information,arguing that the benefit of Henry's hypothetical measure might also be achieved in another way,citing seemingly irrefutable evidence that contradicts one of the stated premises on which Henry's argument depends,providing additional information in support of Henry's argument,A
-6,Method of Reasoning,Challenging,"The government's renewable energy policy will favor either the solar energy industry or the hydropower industry. According to reliable sources in the Energy ministry, the government has assessed that the negative impact of hydropower industry on the environment is much greater than that of solar energy industry. This government is committed to improve the environment. It is therefore almost certain that the renewable energy policy will favor the solar energy industry.

The argument proceeds by",concluding that a particular event is unlikely to occur by explaining why the only available alternative will probably occur,concluding that one event is highly likely to occur by refuting the likelihood of the only available alternative,"inferring, from a claim that only one of two events will occur, that the other event will not occur",predicting a future event on the basis of statistical analysis,treating something that is probable as though it were inevitable,B
-7,Point at Issue,Challenging,"Melissa: In the last one year, the sale of biscuits, which are one of the cheapest retail food items, has fallen in the rural areas by more than 5 percent. This means that the rural citizens of our country are becoming poorer and are not being able to afford even the cheapest food items.

Mark: Nonsense. During the last one year alone, 10 percent of the rural population of our country has migrated to urban areas for the long-term.

Which one of the following is a point of disagreement between Melissa and Mark?",The rural citizens of the country are experiencing economic stress due to falling sale of biscuits.,The sale of biscuits in rural areas has declined due to falling rural incomes.,The affordability of the cheapest food items in the rural areas increases with increased migration of people from rural to urban areas.,Migration of people from rural to urban areas adversely impacts the poorest citizens of the country.,"With the migration of people from rural to urban areas, the sale of biscuits in the urban areas is bound to increase.",B
7,Point at Issue,Challenging,"Tony: Most web-pages on the internet have numerous enticing and hard-to-ignore hyperlinks, with each hyperlink leading to further hyperlinks and so on. Regularly falling into this bottomless hole of distracting and mostly trivial information on the internet decreases the ability of heavy internet users to do complex reasoning that requires focus and attention.

James: A research study has found that heavy internet users did better than infrequent users on tests for focus and attention and also had stronger muscles in the brain areas associated with complex reasoning, which suggests a higher usage of these muscles.

The dialogue most strongly supports the claim that Tony and James disagree with each other about whether",focus and attention are necessary to do complex reasoning,most web-pages on the internet require internet users to do complex reasoning,most web-pages on the internet have hard-to-ignore hyperlinks,heavy internet usage decreases a person's ability to do complex reasoning,heavy internet users are more knowledgeable than infrequent internet users,D
8,Role Play,Medium,"Human communication comprises two modes – speech, and movements of the arms and hands, termed gestures. Of these, the gestural mode is likely to have evolved substantially earlier than speech. Apes, which are ancestors of humans, lack speech but gesture on a regular basis in their natural communication. They develop a multifaceted repertoire of gestures, and like pre-linguistic human infants, they use their gestures as intentional acts to draw attention to themselves.

Which one of the following most accurately describes the role played in the argument by the claim that the gestural mode of human communication is likely to have evolved substantially earlier than the speech mode?",It calls into question the basis of the claim that the modes of human communication evolved from apes.,It is the conclusion of the argument.,It supports the conclusion that that the communication skills of apes are at par with those of pre-linguistic human infants.,It provides evidence that apes are ancestors of humans.,It is an assumption used by the argument to justify the absence of speech in apes.,B
-8,Role Play,Challenging,"The Urban Intelligence Unit publishes an annual Livability Ranking, which ranks 100 American cities for their quality of life based on assessments of urban infrastructure, healthcare, education, crime rates, culture and climate. Yet, this ranking should also consider unemployment rates. After all, if a city is unable to offer work opportunities to a sizeable proportion of its population that needs to work for survival, the quality of life for that proportion would be abysmal.

The claim that the Livability Ranking should consider unemployment rates in a city plays which one of the following roles in the argument?",It offers a reason to support the conclusion.,It is an assertion that refutes the conclusion.,It is a principle from which the conclusion is derived.,It is a premise of the argument.,It is a conclusion of the argument.,E
9,Strengthen,Medium,"Astragalus linifolius, a rare plant species that is found only in the Colorado region of the United States, reproduces when a pollinating agent like a fly or a bee carries the pollen grain from the male part of one plant to the female part of another plant of the same species. To maintain the population of this species, the use of pesticides that control grasshoppers should be banned in this region. These pesticides also often result in significant mortality among the Bombylius flies that are the most important pollinating agents of A. linifolius.

Which one of the following, if true, most strengthens the argument?",A. linifolius has a short life-span.,"A. linifolius is also pollinated, though to a much-lesser degree, by some local species of bees.",The pesticides that control insect herbivores other than grasshoppers are even more toxic to Bombylius flies.,Bombylius flies do not reproduce very fast and their populations do not recover for many years after one spraying of a pesticide that controls grasshoppers.,The populations of some other plant species in the Colorado region have decreased to an even greater extent than the population of A. linifolius since the spraying of pesticides that control grasshoppers first started in the region.,D
-9,Strengthen,Hard,"In the 1920s, surveys of factory workers who painted watch dials with luminous paint found an alarming incidence of anemia, loss of teeth, bone fractures and death from cancer. This paint contained radium, a radioactive element. As a result, the industrial use of radioactive luminous paint was completely stopped by 1960. However, radium stays active for hundreds of years. Therefore, those watch-collectors who own watches that have luminous dials and were made before 1960 should either bury these watches in the ground or store them in thick lead boxes to protect themselves and the people around them from anemia, loss of teeth, bone fractures and death from cancer.

Which one of the following, if true, LEAST strengthens the argument above?","The surveys also found that the incidence of anemia, loss of teeth, bone fractures and death from cancer among factory workers who painted watch dials with non-luminous paint was not greater than that among the general population.","The surveys also found that factory workers who painted watch dials with luminous paint, the extent of their health problems was directly proportional to the cumulative number of hours for which they had worked with luminous paint till then.",Barriers of lead or earth provide adequate protection to human beings from harmful radioactive substances.,People who wear watches that have luminous dials and were made before 1960 for more than a decade have an alarming incidence of anemia.,"Most chemists and laboratory workers who worked with radium for more than a year in the first decade after its discovery in 1898 did not have, for the rest of their lives, a greater incidence of anemia, loss of teeth, bone fractures and death from cancer than the general population.",E
-10,Weaken the Argument,Medium,"This year, the cotton crop in Alabama has been attacked by a new, hardy variety of bollworm that is resistant to all known pesticides. Due to this, the cotton production of the state has declined by 40 percent this year. Since this bollworm variety reproduces rapidly, it is likely to spread through all cotton-producing states of the United States by the next year and, therefore, we can expect a decline of at least 40 percent in the amount of cotton produced in the country next year.

Which one of the following, if true, most weakens the argument?",Many other crops in Alabama too have been attacked by this bollworm variety this year.,The natural predators of this bollworm variety are not able to survive in Alabama while cotton-farms in other cotton-producing states have large populations of these predators.,"Ninety-five percent of all cotton produced in the United States is of the Upland variety, which is also the only variety of cotton that is grown in Alabama.",The domestic prices of cotton are not likely to increase next year as the United States will be able to meet its domestic demand for cotton through imports.,Agricultural scientists in the United States are making a massive effort to soon develop a variety of genetically-modified cotton that is resistant to this bollworm variety.,B
10,Weaken the Argument,Hard,"A study of young and middle-aged men in the United States has found that the men whose diet was high in saturated fat also had a high amount of blood cholesterol. In another experiment, when the blood cholesterol level of laboratory rabbits was raised by feeding them exclusively on cholesterol, fat deposits formed in their blood vessels. Similar fat deposits are found in human patients of heart disease. Therefore, to reduce the occurrence of heart disease, people should reduce their dietary consumption of saturated fat.

Each of the following, if true, weakens the above argument EXCEPT:",The bodily reactions of animal models to internal or external stimulants are often poor predictors of the reactions of the human body to the same stimulants.,The per capita consumption of saturated fat in the United States has decreased by 27 percent since 1970 while the occurrence of heart disease in the country has increased by 400 percent in the same period.,"An analysis of studies done on more than 600,000 men and women has established that blood cholesterol is inversely associated with the risk of death from infectious respiratory and digestive diseases.","A study that covered more than 10,000 individuals has found no relationship between the amount of blood cholesterol and the occurrence of heart disease.","In a study where the dietary saturated fat consumption of young and middle-aged American women was three to seven times higher than normal, the blood cholesterol level remained unchanged.",C
